# Projet-Taxi-Reservation
Projet en formation "Développeur d'application multimédia"

Added the file ".env.local" manually to run the database in localhost using xampp.
Commented the line 2 and 3 in the file ".gitignore" in order to add the .env.local file automatically through github desktop app and pushed the commit

After downloading the code run the command "composer install" or "composer update" in the terminal of vs code after opening the project in order to intoduce the "var and vendor" folders as they are ignored by git to avoid cache problems.
